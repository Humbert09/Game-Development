# 🎮 Game Development Projects

Welcome to my **Game Development Repository**!  
This is where I store and showcase my projects created with **Unity** and **C#**.  
Each project represents a step in my journey to learn and improve in game design, programming, and interactive experiences.

## 🕹️ Current Projects

### 1. 2D Game
A classic-style 2D game developed in Unity.  
It focuses on smooth player controls, collision detection, and creative level design.

### 2. Virtual Tour
An immersive virtual environment project that allows players to explore digital spaces interactively.  
Built with Unity’s 3D features to simulate realistic movement and perspective.

## 🧠 Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A **learning space** to practice and document my progress.
- A **portfolio** of completed and ongoing Unity projects.
- A **sandbox** for testing new ideas and mechanics in game development.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Engine:** Unity  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Focus:** 2D & 3D gameplay, interaction systems, and virtual environments

## 🚀 Future Goals
- Expand my virtual tour project with interactive objects.  
- Develop a small 3D adventure prototype.  
- Experiment with Unity physics and AI behavior.
